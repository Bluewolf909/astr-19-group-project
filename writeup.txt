In the first cell, we import all of the modules that we need.

In the second, we have the downloaded data already set up in array format. 

In the third, we have a function that decimalizes time, followed by a call of the function and a np.linspace to make a point for every hour. 

Next, we set sigma and yerr, so that we can plot the data with error bars in the following cell. 

In the seventh cell, we define a model for our data, and then use it as well with optimize to fit a line, which we then plot.

The following three cells then work to subtract the data from the model and then to histogram the residuals in an effort to find the scatter. 
	Our std is greater than the original error bars in the data of 0.25
	the residuals show that our model does not fit the data within the error bars
	and that the instrisic scatter is about 3.09 measning that the error is not from the mesurments
	rather that our curve was not a super good fit to the data.
