We downloaded the data set, and uploaded it to the jupyter notebook as a cell. 
We then made a function that decimalized time and used it.
Next, we plotted the datapoints. 
Afterwords, we worked on to find the best fit line and did so. 
After that, we subtracted the model from the data, plotted the residuals, and then histogrammed them to find the statistics.
	The scatter is indeed greater than the assumed experimental error. This is likley due to the curve not fitting that data perfectly. The scatter is likley around 3.09.
